8. make buttons + stuff resizable in pages
9. use bublle check to fix the trash stuff ur getting in 1st measure
10. handle key changes + accidentals and stuff
11. fix code so that it uses the object lists ur creating instead of creating a new version that isnt object based as u go
12. fix measure classes to have getters (methods thst basically return already existing info, used for less bugs)
    for measure+margin bounds + replace in functions that use the bounds with the getter methods

use the dictionary to check outside that range in the function
